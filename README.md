Exhaustive Algorithm is backtracking

Basic Greedy Heuristic:
    - Iterate over M, choose triples in order only if they don't overlap.
    - Time complexity will be n^2 (where n is the number of things in M), because we have to iterate over M and check our selection at any iteration.

To Do:
    - Test timing for exhaustive search
    - Implement various functions for m of N and track time across these
    - Implement heuristic algorithm and test time for m function of N, same instances as exhaustive
